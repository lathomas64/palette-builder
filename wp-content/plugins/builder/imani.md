## Tasks
### Imani

#### Airtable
- [ ] Builder Front-End Interface Data processing: fix Shopify JSON flatten

#### Wordpress/Import/back-end stuff
- [ ] Data import: Brand doesn't seem to be mapping to shadow or series.
  * Addt'l info: In the importer, doesn't show the ACF Brand field as relationship
  - [ ] site siezes up sometimes -- maybe better with cache plugin?
      * Gina note: I'd be interested to see what insight Linode has. The size seizes even if I am just saving settings too often. I wonder if there's a cap on requests to the server.
