### Gina's Notes For Imani
- none presently

### Changes/Additions
- [ ] Need to overwrite, save new saved palette
- [ ] how to remove saved palettes
- [ ] Remember closing help boxes

### Bugs
- [ ] Light/Dark and Dark/light sort are switched
- [ ] color family, color temperature, and finish display as unknown if multiple values present.
  * Note on this: when filtering by color family, some shadows show up with "unknown" in the CF field that clearly don't belong in the results, but not *all* of those kinds of shadows do. Gina can show behavior if needed. 
  * just pick the first if we have multiples (for now. Gina may have different schema later)
- [ ] Attempting to load user color story breaks the whole thing
- [X] 2x when building a larger story, clicking on the right side of the palette made the size reset to 3x3
