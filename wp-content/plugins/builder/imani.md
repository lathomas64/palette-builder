### Gina's Notes For Imani
- none presently

### Changes/Additions
- [ ] Need to overwrite, save new saved palette
- [ ] how to remove saved palettes
- [ ] Remember closing help boxes

### Bugs
- [ ] Using X to clear search field does not update list
- [x] Vivid/muted and Muted/Vivid sort are switched
- [ ] color family, color temperature, and finish display as unknown if multiple values present.
  * Gina changed color family & color temperature to one combined field. Take the first color tag and display here.  
  * just pick the first if we have multiples (for now. Gina may have different schema later)
- [ ] Attempting to load user color story breaks the whole thing
- [X] 2x when building a larger story, clicking on the right side of the palette made the size reset to 3x3

## Tasks
### Imani

#### Airtable
- [ ] Data processing: fix Airtable photo export so that it pulls more than 100 images
- [ ] Builder Front-End Interface Data processing: fix Shopify JSON flatten

#### Wordpress/Import/back-end stuff
- [ ] Data import: Brand doesn't seem to be mapping to shadow or series.
  * Addt'l info: In the importer, doesn't show the ACF Brand field as relationship
  - [ ] site siezes up sometimes -- maybe better with cache plugin?
      * Gina note: I'd be interested to see what insight Linode has. The size seizes even if I am just saving settings too often. I wonder if there's a cap on requests to the server.
