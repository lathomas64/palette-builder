## Gina's Notes For Imani

### Changes/Additions
— Single click should also add shadow to palette — Top left-most available space

### Bugs
— Hover panel doesn’t display image when filters are engaged
— Can’t drag into rightmost column of palette?
	—I tried hiding the detail panel on drag but still seems to be blocking it. (Have since removed)
— Pre-created stories are empty now
