### Gina's Notes For Imani
- none presently

### Changes/Additions
- [ ] Single click should also add shadow to palette — Top left-most available space
- [ ] When palette overflows, shadow gets pushed to maybe pile. Be sure to animate this. (ie, need indicator of what got dropped)
      -- Maybe when they're dragging over a full palette, shading message comes up "Hey look! listen! If you drop this, X will get moved to the maybe pile" 

### Bugs
- [ ] Hover panel doesn’t display image when filters are engaged
- [ ] Text filter doesn't work when filters are engaged
- [x] Can’t drag into rightmost column of palette?
	     —I tried hiding the detail panel on drag but still seems to be blocking it. (Have since removed)
       — nvm I found a solution
- [ ] Pre-created stories are empty now
- [ ] Can't drag shadows when on palette (pan controls likely getting in way)
