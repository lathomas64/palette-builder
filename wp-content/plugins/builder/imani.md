## Gina's Notes For Imani

### Changes/Additions
- [x] Single click should also add shadow to palette — Top left-most available space

### Bugs
- [ ] Hover panel doesn’t display image when filters are engaged
- [x] Can’t drag into rightmost column of palette?
	     —I tried hiding the detail panel on drag but still seems to be blocking it. (Have since removed)
       — nvm I found a solution
- [ ] Pre-created stories are empty now
    - The connection appears to have been lost in the shadow shuffle. reconnecting in the backend and they work. story functionality is still working okay
- [ ] Can't drag shadows when on palette (pan controls likely getting in way)
